# Code of Conduct

This is the code of conduct we live on as part of PT Koneksi Integrasi (Koneksi). Everything we do in our daily work reflect all of the principles laid out here. When you are not sure, come back here to align yourself with our goals **as a team**.

The success of Koneksi directly correlates with the success of its people.

## Manifesto

> A manifesto is a published verbal declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government. [Link &raquo;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto)

```
Customers are people, people are not machines
Koneksi is the people, people are not machines

Products are values created for our Customers
Analytics and Data governs success
Assumptions are there to be proven
Gut feel governs our maturity

Machines are our medium to deliver values
Codes governs the machines we provision
Deliverables are best Done than perfect

Communication is our achilles heel
Over Communicating is always better than under

People work with their strength
Decisions are better than no decision
Koneksi (is the people) is our product

Revenue is our sustainable pride.
```

## Rule of Thumb

When in doubt, always refer to the Manifesto. All of our work must reflect our Manifesto.
